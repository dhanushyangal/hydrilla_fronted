    question: "What does Hydrilla AI do?",
    answer: "Hydrilla AI helps studios and professional artists generate production-usable 3D assets from text or image inputs in minutes."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is Hydrilla AI built for?",
    answer: "Hydrilla is built for game studios, animation teams, and professional 3D artists who need fast asset creation for prototyping and production workflows."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of 3D assets can I generate?",
    answer: "You can generate single objects and simple background assets such as props, environment elements, and modular structures."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Hydrilla AI suitable for final production assets?",
    answer: "Hydrilla is best suited for background assets, prototyping, and early production stages. Final hero assets may still require manual refinement."
  },
  {
    question: "What input methods are supported?",
    answer: "You can generate 3D assets using either a text description or a reference image of a single object."
  },
  {
    question: "What file formats are supported?",
    answer: "Hydrilla supports exporting 3D assets in GLB and FBX formats, compatible with Blender, Unity, and Unreal Engine."
  },
  {
    question: "Are the generated assets textured?",
    answer: "Yes, generated assets include basic textures suitable for immediate use and further refinement in your pipeline."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need 3D expertise to use Hydrilla?",
    answer: "No advanced 3D expertise is required. Hydrilla is designed to be simple and accessible while still meeting professional needs."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to generate an asset?",
    answer: "Most assets are generated within a few minutes, depending on complexity and selected quality."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I edit the generated assets?",

  },
  {
    question: "Does Hydrilla support animation or rigging?",
    answer: "Animation and rigging are not supported in the current version. Hydrilla focuses on static 3D asset generation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Hydrilla assets commercially?",
    answer: "Yes, assets generated using Hydrilla can be used in commercial projects, subject to the terms of service."
  },
